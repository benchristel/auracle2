some discomfort i conjectured that this undocumented country and its anonymous heresiarch were a fiction devised by modesty in order to justify astatement the fruitless examination of one of justus perthes atlases fortified my doubt the following day called me from buenos aries he told me he had before him the article on in volume of the encyclopedia the heresiarchs name was not forthcoming but there was a note on his doctrine formulated in words almost identical to those he had repeated though perhaps literally inferior he had recalled copulation and mirrors are abominable the text of the encyclopedias aid for one of those gnostics the visible universe was an illusion or more precisely asophism mirrors and fatherhood are abominable because they multiply and disseminate that universe i told him in all truthfulness that i should like to see that article a few days later he brought it this surprised me since the scrupulous cartographical indices of ritters erdkunde were plentifully ignorant of the name the tome brought was in fact volume of the anglo american cyclopaedia on the half title page and the spine the alphabetical marking tor ups was that of our copy but instead of it contained pages these four additional pages made up the article on which as the reader will have noticed was not indicated by the alphabetical marking we later determined that there was no other difference between the volumes both of them as i believe i have indicated are reprints of the tenth encyclopaedia britannica had acquired his copy at some sale or other we read the article with some care the passage recalled by was perhaps the only surprising one the rest of it seemed very plausible quite in keeping with the general tone of the work and as is natural a bit boring reading it over again we discovered beneath its rigorous prose a fundamental vagueness of the fourteen names which figured in the geographical part we only recognized three khorasan armenia erzerum interpolated in the text in an ambiguous way of the historical names only one the impostor magicians merdis invoked more as a metaphor the note seemed to fix the boundaries of but its nebulous reference points were rivers and craters and mountain ranges of that same region we read for example that the lowlands of tsai khaldun and the axa delta marked the southern frontier and that on the islands of the delta wild horses procreate all this on the first part of page in the historical section page we learned that as a result of the religious persecutions of the thirteenth century the orthodox believers sought refuge on these islands where to this day their obelisks remain and where it is not uncommon to unearth their stone mirrors the section on language and literature was brief only one trait is worthy of recollection it noted that the literature of was one of fantasy and that its epics and legends never referred to reality but to the two imaginary regions of and the bibliography enumerated four volumes which we have not yet found though the third silas history of the land called figures in the catalogs of bernard quartichs bookshop the first dates from and is the work of johannes valentinus andrea this fact is significant a few years later i came upon that name in the unsuspected pages of de quincey writings volume and learned that it belonged to a german theologian who in the early seventeenth century described the imaginary community of rosae crucis a community that others founded later in imitation of what he had prefigured that night we visited the national library in vain we exhausted atlases catalogs annuals of geographical societies travelers and historians memoirs no one had ever been in neither did the general index of encyclopedia register that name the following day carlos mastronardi to whom i had related the matter noticed the black and gold covers of the anglo american cyclopaedia in a bookshop on corrientes and talcahuano he entered and examined volume of course he did not find the slightest indication of some limited and waning memory of herbert ashe an engineer of thesouthern railways persists in the hotel at adrogue amongst the effusive honeysuckles and in the illusory depths of the mirrors in his lifetime hesuffered from unreality as do so many englishmen once dead he is not even the ghost he was then he was tall and listless and his tired rectangular beard had once been red i understand he was a widower without children every few years he would go to england to visit i judge from some photographs he showed us a sundial and a few oaks he and my father had entered into one of those close the adjective is excessive english friendships that begin by excluding confidences and very soon dispense with dialog they used to carry out an exchange of books and newspapers and engage in taciturn chess games i remember him in the hotel corridor with a mathematics book in his hand sometimes looking at the irrecoverable colors of the sky one afternoon we spoke of the duodecimal system of numbering in which twelve is written as as he said that he was converting some kind of tables from the duodecimal to the sexagesimal system in which sixty is written as he added that the task had been entrusted to him by a norwegian in rio grande dusul we had known him for eight years and he had never mentioned in sojourn in that region we talked of country life of the capangas of the brazilian etymology of the word gaucho which some old uruguayans still pronounce gaucho and nothing more was said may god forgive me of duodecimal functions in september of we were not at the hotel herbert ashe died of a ruptured aneurysm a few days before he had received a sealed and certified package from brazil it was a book in large octavo a she left it at the bar where months later i found it i began to leaf through it and experienced an astonished and airy feeling of vertigo which i shall not describe for this is not the story of my emotions but of and and orbis tertius on one of the nights of islam called the night of nights the secret doors of heaven open wide and the water in the jars becomes sweeter if those doors opened i would not feel what i felt that afternoon the book was written in english and contained pages on the yellow leather back i read these curious words which were repeated on the title page a first encyclopedia of vol there was no indication of date or place on the first page and on a leaf of silk paper that covered on of the color plates there was stamped a blue oval with this inscription orbis tertius two years before i had discovered in a volume of a certain pirated encyclopedia a superficial description of a nonexistent country now chance afforded me something more precious and arduous now i held in my hands a vast methodical fragment of an unknown planets entire history with its architecture and its playing cards with the dread of its mythologies and the murmur of its languages with its emperors and its seas with its minerals and its birds and its fish with its algebra and its fire with its theological and metaphysical controversy and all of it articulated coherent with no visible doctrinal intent or tone of parody in the eleventh volume which i have mentioned there are allusions to preceding and succeeding volumes in an article in the n r f which is now classic nestor ibarra has denied the existence of those companion volumes ezequiel martinez estrada and drieu la rochelle have refuted that doubt perhaps victoriously the fact is that up to now the most diligent inquiries have been fruitless in vain we have upended the libraries of the two americas and of europe alfonso reyes tired of these subordinate sleuthing procedures proposes that weshould all undertake the task of reconstructing the many and weighty tomes that are lacking ex ungue leonem he calculates half in earnest and half jokingly that a generation of be sufficient this venturesome computation brings us back to the fundamental problem who are the inventors of the plural is inevitable because the hypothesis of a lone inventor an infinite leibniz laboring away darkly and modestly has been unanimously discounted it is conjectured that this brave new world is the work of a secretsociety of astronomers biologists engineers metaphysicians poets chemists algebraists moralists painters geometers directed by an obscure man of genius individuals mastering these diverse disciplines are abundant but not so those capable of inventiveness and less so those capable of subordinating that inventiveness to a rigorous andsystematic plan this plan is so vast that each writers contribution is infinitesimal at first it was believed that was a mere chaos and irresponsible license of the imagination now it is known that is a cosmos and that the intimate laws which govern it have been formulated at least provisionally let it suffice for me to recall that the apparent contradictions of the eleventh volume are the fundamental basis for the proof that the other volumes exist so lucid and exact is the order observed in it the popular magazines with pardonable excess have spread news of the zoology and topography of i think its transparent tiger and towers of blood perhaps do not merit the continued attention of all men i shall venture to request a few minutes to expound its concept of the universe hume noted for all time that berkeleys arguments did not admit the slightest refutation nor did they cause the slightest conviction this dictum is entirely correct in its application to the earth but entirely false in the nations of this planet are congenitally idealist their language and the derivations of their language religion letters metaphysics all presuppose idealism the world for them is not a concourse of objects in space it is a heterogeneous series of independent acts it is successive and temporal not spatial there are no nouns ins conjectural ursprache from which the present languages and the dialects are derived there are impersonal verbs modified by monosyllabic suffixes or prefixes with an adverbial value for example there is no word corresponding to the word moon but there is a verb which in english would be to moon or to moonate the moon rose above the river is literally upward behind the onstreaming it mooned the preceding applies to the languages of the southern hemisphere in those of the northern hemisphere on whose ursprache there is very little data in the eleventh volume the prime unit is not the verb but the monosyllabic adjective the noun is formed by an accumulation of adjectives they do not say moon but rather round airy light on dark or pale orange of the sky or any other such combination in the example selected the mass of adjectives refers to a real object but this is purely fortuitous the literature of this hemisphere like subsistent world abounds in ideal objects which are convoked and dissolved in a moment according to poetic needs at times they are determined by mere simultaneity there are objects composed of two terms one of visual and another of auditory character the color of the rising sun and the faraway cry of a bird there are objects of many terms the sun and the water on a swimmers chest the vague tremulous rose color we see with our eyes closed the sensation of being carried along by a river and also by sleep these second degree objects can be combined with others through the use of certain abbreviations the process is practically infinite there are famous poems made up of one enormous word this word forms a poetic object created by the author the fact that no one believes in the reality of nouns paradoxically causes their number to be unending the languages of northern hemisphere contain all the nouns of the indo european languages and many others as well it is no exaggeration to state that the classic culture of comprises only one discipline psychology all others are subordinated to it i have said that the men of this planet conceive the universe as a series of mental processes which do not develop in space but successively in time spinoza ascribes to his inexhaustible divinity the attributes of extension and thought no one in would understand the juxtaposition of the first which is typical only of certain states and the second which is a perfect synonym of the cosmos in other words they do not conceive that the spatial persists in time the perception of a cloud of smoke on the horizon and then of the burning field and then of the half extinguished cigarette that produced the blaze is considered an example of association of ideas this monism or complete idealism invalidates all science if we explain or judge a fact we connect it with another such linking in is a later state of the subject which cannot affect or illuminate the previous state every mental state is irreducible there mere fact of naming it i e of classifying it implies a falsification from which it can be deduced that there are no sciences on not even reasoning the paradoxical truth is that they do exist and in almost uncountable number the same thing happens with philosophies as happens with nouns in the northern hemisphere the fact that every philosophy is by definition a dialectical game a philosophie des als ob has caused them to multiply there is an abundance of incredible systems of pleasing design or sensational type the metaphysicians of do notseek for the truth or even for verisimilitude but rather for the astounding they judge that metaphysics is a branch of fantastic literature they know that a system is nothing more than the subordination of all aspects of the universe to any one such aspect even the phrase all aspects is rejectable for it supposes the impossible addition of the present and of all past moments neither is it licit to use the plural past moments since it supposes another operation one of the schools of goes so far as to negate time it reasons that the present is indefinite that the future has no reality other than as a present memory another school declares that all time has already transpired and that our life is only the crepuscular and no doubt falsified an mutilated memory or reflection of an irrecoverable process another that the history of the universe and in it our lives and the most tenuous detail of our lives is the scripture produced by a subordinate god in order to communicate with a demon another that the universe is comparable to those cryptographs in which not all the symbols are valid and that only what happens every three hundred nights is true another that while we sleep here we are awake elsewhere and that in this way every man is two men amongst the doctrines of none has merited the scandalous reception accorded to materialism some thinkers have formulated it with less clarity than fervor as one might put forth a paradox in order to facilitate the comprehension of this inconceivable thesis a heresiarch of the eleventh century devised thesophism of the nine copper coins whosescandalous renown is in equivalent to that of the eleatic paradoxes there are many versions of thisspecious reasoning which vary the number of coins and the number of discoveries the following is the most common on tuesday x crosses a deserted road and loses nine copper coins on thursday y finds in the road four coinssomewhat rusted by wednesdays rain on friday z discovers three coins in the road on friday morning x finds two coins in the corridor of his house the heresiarch would deduce from thisstory the reality i e the continuity of the nine coins which were recovered it is absurd he affirmed to imagine that four of the coins have not existed between tuesday and thursday three between tuesday and friday afternoon two between tuesday and friday morning it is logical to think that they have existed at least insomesecret way hidden from the comprehension of men at every moment of those three periods the language of resists the formulation of this paradox most people did not even understand it the defenders of commonsense at first did no more than negate the veracity of the anecdote they repeated that it was a verbal fallacy based on the rash application of two neologisms not authorized by usage and alien to all rigorous thought the verbs find and lose which beg the question because they presuppose the identity of the first and of the last nine coins they recalled that all nouns man coin thursday wednesday rain have only a metaphorical value they denounced the treacherous circumstancesomewhat rusted by wednesdays rain which presupposes what is trying to be demonstrated the persistence of the four coins from tuesday to thursday they explained that equality is one thing and identity another and formulated a kind of reductio ad absurdum the hypothetical case of nine men who on nine nightssuffer asevere pain would it not be ridiculous they questioned to pretend that this pain is one and thesame theysaid that the heresiarch was prompted only by the blasphemous intention of attributing the divine category of being tosomesimple coins and that at times he negated plurality and at other times did not they argued if equality implies identity one would also have to admit that the nine coins are one unbelievably these refutations were not definitive a hundred years after the problem wasstated a thinker no less brilliant than the heresiarch but of orthodox tradition formulated a very daring hypothesis this happy conjecture affirmed that there is only onesubject that this indivisiblesubject is every being in the universe and that these beings are the organs and masks of the divinity x is y and is z z discovers three coins because he remembers that x lost them x finds two in the corridor because he remembers that the others have been found the eleventh volumesuggests that three prime reasons determined the complete victory of this idealist pantheism the first its repudiation ofsolipsism thesecond the possibility of preserving the psychological basis of thesciences the third the possibility of preserving the cult of the godsschopenhauer the passionate and lucidschopenhauer formulates a verysimilar doctrine in the first volume of parerga und paralipomena the geometry of comprises twosomewhat different disciplines the visual and the tactile the latter corresponds to our own geometry and issubordinated to the first the basis of visual geometry is thesurface not the point this geometry disregards parallel lines and declares that man in his movement modifies the forms whichsurround him the basis of its arithmetic is the notion of indefinite numbers they emphasize the importance of the concepts of greater and lesser which our mathematicianssymbolize as and they maintain that the operation of counting modifies the quantities and converts them from indefinite into definitesums the fact thatseveral individuals who count thesame quantity would obtain thesame result is for the psychologists an example of association of ideas or of a good exercise of memory we already know that in thesubject of knowledge is on and eternal in literary practices the idea of asinglesubject is also all powerful it is uncommon for books to besigned the concept of plagiarism does not exist it has been established that all works are the creation of one author who is atemporal and anonymous the critics often invent authors theyselect two dissimilar works the tao te ching and the nightssay attribute them to thesame writer and then determine mostscrupulously the psychology of this interesting homme de lettres their books are also different works of fiction contain asingle plot with all its imaginable permutations those of a philosophical nature invariably include both the thesis and the antithesis the rigorous pro and con of a doctrine a book which does not contain its counterbook is considered incomplete centuries and centuries of idealism have not failed to influence reality in the most ancient regions of the duplication of lost objects is not infrequent two persons look for a pencil the first finds it andsays nothing thesecond finds asecond pencil no less real but closer to his expectations thesesecondary objects are called hronir and are though awkward in formsomewhat longer until recently the hronir were the accidental products of distraction and forgetfulness itseems unbelievable that their methodical production dates backscarcely a hundred years but this is what the eleventh volume tells us the first efforts were unsuccessful however the modus operandi merits description the director of one of thestate prisons told his inmates that there were certain tombs in an ancient river bed and promised freedom to whoever might make an important discovery during the months preceding the excavation the inmates wereshown photographs of what they were to find this first effort proved that expectation and anxiety can be inhibitory a weeks work with pick andshovel did not mange to unearth anything in the way of a hron except a rusty wheel of a period posterior to the experiment but this was kept insecret and the process was repeated later in fourschools in three of them failure was almost complete in a fourth whose director died accidentally during the first excavations thestudents unearthed or produced a gold mask an archaicsword two or three clay urns and the moldy and mutilated torso of a king whose chest bore an inscription which it has not yet been possible to decipher thus was discovered the unreliability of witnesses who knew of the experimental nature of thesearch mass investigations produce contradictory objects now individual and almost improvised jobs are preferred the methodical fabrication of hronirsays the eleventh volume has performed prodigiousservices for archaeologists it has made possible the interrogation and even the modification of the past which is now no less plastic and docile than the future curiously the hronir ofsecond and third degree the hronir derived from another hron those derived from the hron of a hron exaggerate the aberrations of the initial one those of fifth degree are almost uniform those of ninth degree become confused with those of thesecond in those of the eleventh there is a purity of line not found in the original the process is cyclical the hron of the twelfth degree begins to fall off in qualitystranger and more pure than any hron is at times the ur the object produced throughsuggestion educed by hope the great golden mask i have mentioned is an illustrious example things became duplicated in they also tend to become effaced and lose their details when they are forgotten a classic example is the doorway whichsurvivedso long it was visited by a beggar and disappeared at his death at timessome birds a horse havesaved the ruins of an amphitheater postscript i reproduce the preceding article just as it appeared in the anthology of fantastic literature with no omission other than that o f a few metaphors and a kind

hinton which had belonged to herbert ashe the envelope bore a cancellation from ouro preto the letter completely elucidated the mystery of its text corroborated the hypotheses of martinez estrada one night in lucerne or in london in the earlyseventeenth century thesplendid history has its beginning asecret and benevolentsociety amongst whose members were dalgarno and later george berkeley arose to invent a country its vague initial program included hermeticstudies philanthropy and the cabala from this first period dates the curious book by andrea after a few years ofsecret conclaves and

ascetic millionaire ezra buckley the lattersomewhat disdainfully let himspeak and laughed at the plans modestscope he told the agent that in america it was absurd to invent a country and proposed the invention of a planet to this gigantic idea he added another a product of his nihilism that of keeping the enormous enterprise asecret at that time the twenty volumes of the encyclopaedia britannica were circulating in the unitedstates buckleyysuggested that a methodical encyclopedia of the imaginary planet be written he was to leave them his mountains of gold his navigable rivers his pasture

the last volume of the first encyclopedia of the edition was asecret one its fourty volumes the vastest undertaking ever carried out by man would be the basis for another more detailed edition written not in english but in one of the languages of this revision of an illusory world was called provisionally orbis tertius and one of its modest demiurgi was herbert ashe whether as an agent of gunnar erfjord or as an affiliate i do not know his having received a copy of the eleventh volume wouldseem to favor the latter assumption but what about the others in events became more intense i recall one of the first of these with particular clarity and itseems that i perceived thensomething of its premonitory character it happened in an apartment on lapridastreet facing a high and light balcony which looked out toward thesunset princess faucigny lucinge had received hersilverware from pointiers from the vast depths of a box embellished with foreignstamps delicate immobile objects emergedsilver from utrecht and paris covered with hard heraldic fauna and asamovar amongst them with the perceptible and tenuous tremor of asleeping bird a compass vibrated mysteriously the princess did not recognize it its blue needle longed from magnetic north its metal case was concave inshape the letters around its edge corresponded to one of the alphabets ofsuch was the first intrusion of this fantastic world into the world of reality i amstill troubled by thestroke of chance which made me witness of thesecond intrusion as well it happenedsome months later at a countrystore owned by a brazilian in cuchilla negra amorim and i were returning fromsant anna the river tacuarembo had flooded and we were obliged tosample and endure the proprietors rudimentary hospitality he provided us withsome creaking cots in a large room cluttered with barrels and hides we went to bed but were kept fromsleeping until dawn by the drunken ravings of an unseen neighbor who intermingled inextricable insults withsnatches of milongas or rather withsnatches of thesame milonga as might besupposed we attributed this insistent uproar to thestore owners fiery cane liquor by daybreak the man was dead in the hallway the roughness of his voice had deceived us he was only a youth in his delirium a few coins had fallen from his belt along with a cone of bright metal thesize of a die in vain a boy tried to pick up this cone a man wasscarcely able to raise it from the ground it held in my hand for a few minutes i remember that its weight was intolerable and that after it was removed the feeling of oppressiveness remained i also remember the exact circle it pressed into my palm thesensation of a verysmall and at thesame time extremely heavy object produced a disagreeable impression of repugnance and fear one of the local mensuggested we throw it into theswollen river amorim acquired it for a few pesos no one knew anything about the dead man except that he came from the border thesesmall very heavy cones made from a metal which is not of this world are images of the divinity in certain regions of here i bring the personal part of my narrative to a close the rest is in the memory if not in the hopes or fears of all my readers let itsuffice for me to recall or mention the following facts with a mere brevity of words which the reflective recollection of all will enrich or amplify around a person doing research fro the newspaper the american of nashville tennessee brought to light in a memphis library the forty volumes of the first encyclopedia of even today there is a controversy over whether this discovery was accidental or whether it was permitted by the directors of thestill nebulous orbis tertius the latter is most likelysome of the incredible aspects of the eleventh volume for example the multiplication of the hronir have been eliminated or attenuated in the memphis copies it is reasonable to imagine that these omissions follow the plan of exhibiting a world which is not too incompatible with the real world the dissemination of objects from over different countries would complement this plan the fact is that the international press infinitely proclaimed the find manuals anthologiessummaries literal versions authorized re editions and pirated editions of the greatest work of man flooded andstill flood the earth almost immediately reality yielded on more than one account the truth is that it longed to yield ten years ago anysymmetry with a resemblance of order dialectical materialism antisemitism nazism wassufficient to entrance the minds of men how could

Auracle 2.0 is a successor to the original
[Auracle](https://benchristel.github.io/auracle), which I
wrote several years ago. Both Auracle and Auracle 2.0 are
word generators. They let you input a small amount of text
and from that they can (at least in theory) generate a whole
language's worth of words that have the same general
aesthetic.
